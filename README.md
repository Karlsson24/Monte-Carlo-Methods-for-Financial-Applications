# Monte-Carlo-Methods-for-Financial-Applications
In "Computer Assignment 1," I priced European options where S(t) denoted the value of the underlying stock, which was assumed to follow a geometric Brownian motion. I used 20,000 simulations for each price calculation and presented my results in a table, one for each of the assignments (see table formats at the end). I provided my answers with 3 decimal places.

Additionally, for problems 1 and 2, I compared the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method to the variance reduction method for an increasing number of simulations. For each problem, I calculated the price using 10,000, 20,000, and up to 100,000 simulations. I then plotted the prices, for both the standard MC and the variance reduction method, using a line plot with the number of simulations on the x-axis.

In "Computer Assignment 2," I priced European stock options using importance sampling and Quasi-Monte Carlo (Quasi-MC) with 20,000 simulations for the first four problems. For problems 1 and 2, I compared the standard Monte Carlo (MC) method to all the variance reduction methods, including those from "Computer Assignment 1," for an increasing number of simulations. For each problem, I calculated the price using 10,000, 20,000, and up to 100,000 simulations. I then plotted the prices for both the standard MC and the variance reduction methods (including Quasi-MC), using a line plot with the number of simulations on the x-axis.

In the last two problems, I priced interest rate derivatives using Vasicekâ€™s short rate model.

In "Computer Assignment 3," I examined how dynamic delta hedging worked for different rebalancing frequencies in the first problem. In the second and third problems, I calculated the Greeks. In the last two problems, I applied binomial trees and the least squares Monte Carlo method to American options
